__F5 BIG-IP Account Factory Customization__
 
This solution deploys the following:
 
- A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
- BIG-IP Virtual Edition (VE) instances deployed to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2).
- A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*

In the public subnets:
- Managed NAT gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
- A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*
- NICs for BIG-IP's data plane traffic
 
In the private subnets:
- NICs for BIG-IP's management access
- An example application to help demonstrate BIG-IP VE functionality.*

As well as:

- An Amazon S3 SSE-S3 encrypted bucket used to provide failover state.
- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Instance Profile to allow BIG-IP to remap Network resources and access the S3 Bucket for failover state.

***\* = Optional***: *Depending on deploying a full or existing network stack as well as various parameters.* 

This solution is for infrastructure engineers, platform engineers and security engineers and provides a validated configuration point for BIG-IP usecases in AWS. For more detail of the template, options and other F5 related information please see below.
