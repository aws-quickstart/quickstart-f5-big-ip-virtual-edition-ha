Deploying this Quick Start for a new virtual private cloud (VPC) with
default parameters builds the following {partner-product-short-name} environment in the
AWS Cloud.

Figure 1: Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS

As shown in Figure 1, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*

* In the public subnets:

** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure
Shell (SSH) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*
** The public-facing network interface card (NIC) of a clustered pair of {partner-product-short-name} instances.

* In the private subnets:
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram.

** The management NICs of a clustered pair of {partner-product-short-name} instances (an out-of-band management network).
** An example application to help demonstrate {partner-product-short-name} functionality.

* An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role and instance profile.
* An Amazon S3 bucket used to provide failover state.

/* The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips
the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC
configuration.
